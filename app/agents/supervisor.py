"""Step 9 — Supervisor (router) node.

Reads the question once, picks which agents to run, and resolves shared context
(team id, opponent, next fixture) so the three agents don't each repeat that
lookup. ``with_structured_output`` forces a typed routing object instead of messy
free text. Deterministic guardrails keep routing reliable when the LLM omits agents.
